# hello-world
My first github project

I am doing the tutorial. The instructions are to say a bit about myself. So here goes:

1. I work as a sysadmin for The Nielsen Co.
2. I am trying to learn something about Jenkins right now.
3. In my spare time, I like girl bands, for instance Skating Polly and Palehound.
